  <h2>Founder’s Real Story</h2>

      <p>
        My name is <strong>Mayur Vaishali Subhash Thoke</strong>, and Subhvaishali is not just an organisation —
        it is my life story.
      </p>

      <p>
        I lost both of my parents at the age of seven. After my father passed away, my aunt took my responsibility and 
        tried to give me a better life by sending me to a hostel in the city. But instead of finding safety, I was 
        cheated and sent to a <strong>remand home in Ahmednagar</strong>, where I spent one difficult year of my childhood.
      </p>

      <p>
        Later, I found shelter in <strong>Swami Sahajanand Bharti Godavari Ashram, Naur Gurukul</strong>, where I lived 
        for six years. That place became my home, my support, and the foundation of my strength.
      </p>

      <p>
        After leaving the ashram, I completed my 11th and 12th at 
        <strong>Borawake College, Shrirampur</strong> while working to support myself. Eventually, I secured admission 
        in <strong>Government Medical College & Sir JJ Group of Hospitals, Mumbai</strong> — something that once felt 
        impossible for a child like me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Growing up in hostels, ashrams, and different parts of society taught me what vulnerability feels like — and 
        how powerful kindness can be.  
        Many people guided and supported me, and it made me realise:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “If society is the reason I stand here today, then I must become the reason someone else stands tomorrow.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Subhvaishali is named after my parents — a promise to ensure no child feels abandoned or voiceless.  
        Through this foundation, I want to convert my struggles into someone else’s strength.
